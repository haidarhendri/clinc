#Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to Open Blog.  We want to make the blog the best it can possibly be.  In general, when we need 
something (like translations) we can't do ourselves, we add an issue in the [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/enlivenapp/Open-Blog-3/issues) with the tag 'help wanted'.

When you contribute to Open Blog please make sure to include a README.md update under 'Translators/Contributors' (as appropriate) with:

* Your Name
* Link to your site/github/wherever. (optional)

We like to give credit where credit is due.


#Translations

We need translations. If you would like to help translate files, please check the [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/enlivenapp/Open-Blog-3/issues) and look for the 'help wanted' and 'Translate' tags.

#Bug Fixes

If you think you found a bug please create a new issue in the [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/enlivenapp/Open-Blog-3/issues). Once we confirm a bug, we tag it with 'bug'.  We always appreciate a PR to help fix bugs.
